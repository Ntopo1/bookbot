# Book Bot
BookBot is my first project! I built a Python program that analyzes an entire book and generates a statistical report. This project demonstrates my understanding of Python fundamentals, Git, and VS Code, learned in [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev). I also utilized Git to manage version control and deployed the project here on GitHub.
